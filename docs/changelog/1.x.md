# \[1.x] Stable
## \[1.3] 2021-12-30
### Added
- **EventCallFrom**. Call _any_ function from _any_ node in the current scene with its NodePath. [#18](https://github.com/AnidemDex/Godot-EventSystem/pull/18)

### Fixed
- **Invalid operands 'String' and 'Nil' in operator 'in'.** See https://github.com/AnidemDex/Godot-EventSystem/issues/19

### Changed
- **`EventWait.wait_time` now has an unlimited/unfixed wait time**. Yeah, make your events wait for more than a minute for no apparent reason [#20](https://github.com/AnidemDex/Godot-EventSystem/pull/20)
- **`EventSet` now extends from `EventCallFrom`.** This let you set any property from any node in the scene.
- **`EventShow` now extends from `EventCallFron`.** This let you `show` any node in the scene.
- **`EventHide` now extends from `EventCallFrom`.** This let you `hide` any node in the scene. 

### Deprecated
- **`EventCall`**. Now is replaced by `EventCallFrom`. This script will be removed in future versions.

## \[1.2.1] 2021-12-10
### Changed
- **EventManager is a tool script now**. This doesn't breaks any code and will not (or is not supposed to) execute code in your scene (but be careful when using tool scripts with EventManager).
- **Scripts were hidden in editor**. Let's avoid removing those by accident.
- **EventManager and Event will now start deferred**. `start_on_ready` and `_execute` calls will be deferred to let the user configure the event one frame before is being executed. This also let it does physics things inside the event.

## \[1.2] 2021-12-05
### Added
- **Event Inspector.** Now the inspector will look better for events. [f1b558d](https://github.com/AnidemDex/Godot-EventSystem/commit/f1b558d53541cab5c74f1900cd2767a0f33c2a39)
- **Timeline name in the editor.** Now the timeline name will appear next to its path in the timeline editor. [20057dd](https://github.com/AnidemDex/Godot-EventSystem/commit/20057ddc389571920683b2bd98fae27e2ee5f4ee)
- **Plugin method to register more events**. This is a method used internally for other plugins. There's no plan to expose this to the user. [#14](https://github.com/AnidemDex/Godot-EventSystem/pull/14)
- **Timeline history.** Now you can change between timelines with in the timeline editor. Useful when you're editing sub-timelines. [#15](https://github.com/AnidemDex/Godot-EventSystem/pull/15)

## Fixed
- **Resources that extends a class that extends Event can't be added to the timeline editor toolbar**. There was a bug related to registering event scripts to timeline editor toolbar. Is now fixed by [0ddfe73](https://github.com/AnidemDex/Godot-EventSystem/commit/84e00318a9b7d56274cc6b64c9671e8a0322ba46)
