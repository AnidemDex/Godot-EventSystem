# ðŸª§ Godot-EventSystem
An easy but powerful event system implementation for Godot Engine

# ðŸª§ About the plugin
EventSystem is a Godot Plugin that will help you manage events sequentially, easy to implement and highly customizable, allowing you to execute code fragments in order according to the conditions you give it.

This plugin doesn't do much on its own, it promises to help you with the task of controlling events, but these events must be done by you. Some events of tasks commonly done in code are included in this plugin.
